# Elena's Fetch App

Welcome to my app! For the coding challenge, I have created a simple app that displays a dataset from a certain API endpoint. Please forgive the rudimentary design :) 

## How to run
You can visit the Fetch App at: https://elspa4.github.io/fetch-app/

OR 

You can pull clone this repo and run it locally on your machine by simply: 
``` npm i && npm start```


## Testing
I have included one short integration test that can be run with: 
```npm run test```

## Notes
* I used a very simple design that is not particularly user friendly because of the size of the list. I debated doing a scrollable table, but I thought that might not be quite as friendly for users on mobile. Instead, I opted to allow the user to tab through the list based on the List ID.
